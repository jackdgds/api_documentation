# Introduction to APIs

API stands for _Application Programming Interface_.

An API acts as an interface between two systems, allowing users to integrate web technology like features, data, and content from other web services in their own applications.

A simple way to think of an API is to compare one to a calculator: you input some numbers (make a call), something happens in the backend (the calculation), and the data are returned in a format you can use.

APIs are used all over the Internet in all manner of applications and services. A very common example of an API is a travel booking site: you define where and when you want to travel, the API call is made by submitting the request, and the available fares and other options are returned to you. Most of these services do not host the travel information locally â€” they use APIs to gather it from affiliates and return it via their interface.

It is common for companies to have many different APIs so they can provide services from many of their features.
