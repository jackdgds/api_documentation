# API Rate Limiting

Once your account is authenticated, you will be able to make 10,000 calls to the Receptiviti API. Authenticated requests are associated with the authenticated user.

If you prefer to start with a free trial, you will have access to the full 10,000 calls for the first two weeks. If you wish to continue, you will enter our license agreement and the will then have the remainder of your unused calls for the rest of the month until the threshold rolls over for the next month.
