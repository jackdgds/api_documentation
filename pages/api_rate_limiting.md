# API Rate Limiting

You may be given a trial license which lasts for one month and includes 50 calls to the Receptiviti API. Or, if you purchase a license, you will be entitled to a fixed maximum of calls per month (1000, 10,000, 50,000, etc). If you exhaust your limit for a given month, you will have to wait until the reset date to get your next set of calls.
