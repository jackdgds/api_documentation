# API Usage Limitations

A trial license lasts for one month and includes 50 calls to the Receptiviti API. Or, if you purchase a license, you will be entitled to a fixed maximum of calls per month â€” 1000, 10,000, 50,000, etc., depending the agreed-upon terms. If you exhaust your limit for a given month, you will have to wait until the reset date to get your next set of calls.
