# Receptiviti API Overview

Our API allows you to upload and analyze individual writing samples, or to submit and timestamp multiple writing samples from a person or from multiple people. The API will return a series of scores that have been analyzed through LIWC and the Receptiviti engine (for information on these scores, see Receptiviti Metrics Explained).

By engaging with the Receptiviti API, you can gain immensely valuable insight into the emotional state of individuals or groups of people at the time the language was spoken or written, allowing you to better understand how the communication within your company affects the entire organization.

Based on REST principles, the Receptiviti API endpoints return JSON-formatted data analyzed from language samples.

NOTE: _By using the Receptiviti API, you agree to the Terms and Conditions_.
